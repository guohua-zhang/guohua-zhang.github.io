intro: In this project we optimized lane change behaviors of ego vehicle using PPO(Proximal Policy Optimization). To evaluate, we analyzed and compared the performance of proposed policy with TTC(Time to Collision) based policy and found that our approach outperforms baseline policy significantly in most evaluation metrics.
